[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:22 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findargj801_ctl_platform_interfaces.cmake" in
  CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has asked CMake to find a package
  configuration file provided by "argj801_ctl_platform_interfaces", but CMake
  did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by
  "argj801_ctl_platform_interfaces" with any of the following names:

    argj801_ctl_platform_interfacesConfig.cmake
    argj801_ctl_platform_interfaces-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "argj801_ctl_platform_interfaces" to
  CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set "argj801_ctl_platform_interfaces_DIR" to a
  directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "argj801_ctl_platform_interfaces" provides a separate development package
  or SDK, be sure it has been installed.
